Create a modern, single-page CV/portfolio website for "Shashank Dubey" (B.Tech CSE - Cybersecurity). Build with React + Vite, Tailwind CSS, GSAP (including ScrollTrigger) for advanced animations and page transitions; include Framer Motion for small UI transitions. The site must be production-ready, responsive (mobile-first), accessible, and SEO-friendly.

FEATURE UPDATES (new / must-have)
1. Loader:
   - Full-page loader that shows a numeric loading percentage in bold at the bottom-left corner (e.g., "45%") while the app bundles/assets load.
   - Show an animated progress bar and subtle micro-animations; percent text must be large, bold, and anchored bottom-left on all screen sizes.
   - Loader must smoothly progress to 100% and then animate out (fade+slide) revealing the site.
   - Fallback: if an asset fails, show message and a Retry button.

2. Page transitions:
   - Implement site-wide route/section transitions using GSAP: a full-screen overlay that animates in (scaleY from 0 to 1) on navigation, and out on complete.
   - Smooth crossfade for content + staggered reveal of section elements (title → subtitle → cards).
   - Mobile: replace overlay with subtle fade/slide to conserve resources.

3. GitHub button:
   - Prominent GitHub button in header (icon + text) linking to `https://github.com/shashankdubey`.
   - Secondary GitHub CTA near Projects section and on each project card ("View Code").
   - Option to fetch 4 latest public repos via GitHub API (instructions + caching notice in README).

ABOUT ME — (copy to include)
Shashank Dubey — I’m a final-year B.Tech student in Computer Science (specializing in Cybersecurity) based in Bhopal. I’m passionate about building secure, scalable web applications and learning practical defensive and offensive security techniques. I enjoy turning ideas into working products — from frontend UI to backend services — and I actively contribute to projects that prioritize performance, accessibility and robustness. I’m seeking internships and junior roles where I can grow as an engineer and solve real-world problems.

UX & MOTION REQUIREMENTS (details for Replit AI)
- Loader: implement in a central `Loader` component; use GSAP or requestAnimationFrame to animate percent. Display percent text bottom-left with `position: fixed; left: 1rem; bottom: 1rem; font-weight: 700; font-size: clamp(14px, 2vw, 20px);`.
- Page transition overlay: `TransitionOverlay` component that animates with GSAP when nav actions trigger.
- Section reveals: use GSAP ScrollTrigger for headings, cards and skill bars (staggered).
- Buttons: accessible focus states, ripple + scale on hover, shallow shadow.
- Project card hover: 3D tilt + subtle info slide-up on desktop; accessible tap states on mobile.
- Animated SVG section separators and small particle/parallax layer in hero.

THEMING & ACCESSIBILITY
- Provide light/dark toggle; default to dark theme.
- Semantic HTML, aria labels, keyboard navigation, visible focus outlines.
- Images lazy-loaded; critical CSS inlined; code-splitting for heavy libs.

GITHUB & RESUME
- `public/resume.pdf` added and linked to a centered "Download CV" button: `<a href="/resume.pdf" download>Download CV</a>`.
- GitHub header button linking to `https://github.com/shashankdubey`. Provide README instructions to replace with actual username.
- If GitHub API is used, provide instructions and a small caching example in README to avoid rate limits.

FILE & REPO STRUCTURE (must create)
- `public/resume.pdf`
- `src/components/Header.jsx`, `Hero.jsx`, `Loader.jsx`, `TransitionOverlay.jsx`, `ProjectCard.jsx`, `Skills.jsx`, `Education.jsx`, `About.jsx`, `ContactForm.jsx`, `Footer.jsx`
- `src/lib/gsap.js`
- `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`, `package.json`
- `README.md` with deployment + replacement instructions (how to set GitHub username, how to add live demo links, how to toggle light/dark).

DEVELOPER NOTES & OUTPUT CHECKLIST
- The site must run with `npm install` and `npm run dev`.
- Loader percent must reflect actual asset load progress (bundle + images). If fine-grained asset progress isn't available, simulate with pre-defined progress steps while ensuring final transition only after `window.onload` or equivalent.
- Provide default placeholder images and instructions for replacing with screenshots/GIFs.
- Provide clear comments in code where to change personal links (GitHub, resume).
- Ensure the site reads only Shashank Dubey info — do not include or copy any information about Parth or other users.
- Provide a short README section showing how to change the GitHub URL and resume file path.
